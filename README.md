```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for 3D graphics developers who are familiar with the mathematical fundamentals of 3D rendering and want to gain expertise in writing fast rendering engines with advanced techniques using C++ libraries and APIs. A solid understanding of C++ and basic linear algebra, as well as experience in creating custom 3D applications without using premade rendering engines is required.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).


Downloading assets and dependencies:
